<h1>An application that counts your lesson's time!</h1>

This app will show you _the time_ until your university or school class _starts_, as well as how much time _is left until the end_ of the class. 

The birth of the app idea is funny. One time I went to class 2 hours before it.
Halfway through I realized that I was leaving too early. I stood on the street for about 2 hours, and I realized that something had to be done with it. So I decided to create a convenient schedule application.

You can enter your schedule and the application **will make your life easier**. 

With it, you won't forget when you have to get up in the morning, or when you will be at so you don't miss the party after classes!
